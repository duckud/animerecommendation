            A young girl named Ray woke up in a strange building where she found
            herself getting chased by a serial killer right off the bat. After
            escaping from said serial killer, she was forced to face a truth
            she'd rather had forgotten which results in her begging the serial
            killer from before to kill her. They make a promise and agree that
            he will only kill her if she helps him get out of that building.
            With that, they both figth together to get out of the building
            filled with serial killers. I really like the friendship between Ray
            and the serial killer whose name is Zack. Even though they have a
            really weird promise, they really care about eachother which is nice
            to watch.

            Light Yagami, who was an ordinary guy, found a weird notebook laying
            on the floor one day. The notebook claimed that if you write
            someones name in the book while thinking about that persons face,
            the person will die from a heart attack, if it is not specified how
            the person should die. With this book Light had the power to punish
            criminals. His goal was to make people stop comitting crimes by
            showing them that every criminal gets killed and therefore making
            the possible criminals fear it. However, a really successfull
            detective takes it upon him to find out the identity of the person
            behind the notebook. This anime has a lot of tension because both
            the detective "L" and Light, who's also called "Kira" by the public
            are really smart. While L is trying to prove that Light is Kira,
            Light has to look innocent and punish the criminals at the same
            time. It's really intersting and the characters are really
            intersting aswell.

            After seeing that his mom has been murdered, Satoru Fujinima
            involuntraliy travels back in time, which gives him the chance to
            prevent his mothers death. While the incidents around town remind
            him of a childhood trauma that he had forgotten, he begins
            questioning hwo he got the ability to travel time and if that
            ability was enough to save lifes. I'm not a big fan of the time
            travel trope but this anime is genuienly interesting, espacially
            because Satoru not only has to save his mother but also many
            children from the town he lives in.

            Akira Fudo is told from his best friend that an ancient race of
            demons has returned on earth to take back the world from humans and
            the only way to defeat those demons would be to unite himself with a
            demon and fight against them. Akira succeeds in uniting himself with
            a demon, which gives him the abilities of a demon and the soul of a
            human. I really like Akira and Ryo's friendship and the plot is
            really intersting. I feel like many people don't understand that the
            story repeats itself over and over because Ryo, the best friend,
            keeps making the same mistake. It has some weird scenes especially
            in the beginning but the story overall is really good and worth a
            watch.
