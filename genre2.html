            After the death of Meiko Honma her friend group started drifting
            apart from the shock of her death. Ten years later, she suddenly
            reappeared as a ghost that only Jintan, the former leader of the
            group, can see. For her to be able to move on to the afterlife
            Jintan has to fulfill her last wish, the issue being that she forgot
            what her wish was. Therefore it's up to her former friends to figure
            out what her wish was and make it possible for her to rest in peace.
            It's a rather sad story, which I absolutely love in romance, but the
            story is also really cute and the friendship between them is also
            really sweet.

            The popular Shouya was bullying a deaf girl who freshly transferred
            into his class. While Shouya continues bullying her, his classmate
            start turning their backs on him. When the girl transfers schools,
            he becomes a depressed and lonely outcast. When he finds the girl
            again after a few years, he tries to make the bullying up to her, as
            he regrets his actions. To me this movie shows how people can learn
            from their actions and grow as a person. I really like the
            characters and I also like that Shouya decided to make it up to her
            instead of trying to forget what happened. It's a really sad and
            beautiful story. It's also adapted from a real life experience,
            which just makes it more realistic and therefore beautiful in my
            opinion.

            At the end of her first high school year, Futaba encounters her
            first love, Tanaka Kou, who had transferred schools 3 years ago,
            before she got to confess to him. After meeting him again, Futaba
            realizes that he has changed a lot. He got his last name changed and
            also acts differently. Gradually the two come closer again while
            figuring out what happened during the 3 years that they haven't seen
            eachother. I like how the male lead is like a completely different
            person which forces the female lead to get to know him again. But
            even though he changed so much he obviously still has a soft spot
            for her which is really cute to me. I like that she takes her time
            to understand him and to help him open up to her.

            After a family tragedy Tohru Honda was left living in a tent in a
            forest. The tent was soon found by the Sohma family members, which
            caused in her living together with Yuki, Kyo and Shigure Sohma.
            However, she quickly learns that the family has an unique secret
            that they've been hiding: they turn into an animal of the zodiac
            when they hug someone of the opposite sex. I considered putting this
            one in the psychological category, since the romance only really
            starts after a few seasons and the first few seasons are more
            concentrated on the trauma that each of the characters had. But
            since it is some sort of reverse harem, I decided to put it in the
            romance category. I like that each of the characters have their own
            issues and hardships. I also really like how the female lead tries
            her best to help all of them feel better about themselves. It's not
            solely concentrated on the romance which is something I really like
            in romance animes.

            The tired Uenoyoma wanted to take a nap at his favourite spot in
            school during break. But when he arrived there the spot was already
            occupied from the sad Mafuyu and his guitar with the broken strings.
            Instead of sleeping Uenoyoma fixes Mafuyus guitar. As soon as Mafuyu
            notices that Uenoyoma can play the guitar he begs him to teach him
            how to play it aswell. I really love all the characters in this
            anime. I like how Mafuyu has a complicated past and I like how
            Uenoyoma is the first one to fall in love and struggle with it. It's
            a really cute but also sad story.

            afterwards. This anime has a lot of couples an they all have their
            own unique relationship which makes it really interesting. It's a
            really lighthearted and funny anime to watch with really cute

            While visiting her uncle in summer a young girl gets lost in the
            woods alone. As she's trying to find her way back she's rescued by a
            gentle youkai named Gin. He's burdened with a curse that doesn't
            allow him to touch any human, since he would disappear if he did so.
            Even though they can't have physical contact they become really
            close and start meeting eachother every summer. I really like the
            idea of a romance where the main characters can't touch eachother
            even when they're right next to eachother. It's a really bittersweet
            anime but it's definetly worth a watch.

            woman, which resulted in her trying to find Howl to break the curse.
            Aside from being a studio ghilbi movie, I really like the characters
            and I like the idea of a curse. I also really like that Howl is

            person.

            Mitsuha and Taki are complete strangers who live really different
            lives in different places. When Mitsuha makes a wish to leave the
            countryside that she lives in and go to tokyo, they got connected.
            She dreams that she is Taki and Taki dreams that he is Mitsuha. They
            later find out that they're actually switching bodies. It's a really
            odd story that I've never heard of before so I really like. It's
            also a really famous movie and it's very well written.
