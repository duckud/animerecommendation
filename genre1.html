          <h2>Assassination Classroom</h2>
          <p>
            This anime is about a class of students whose job is to kill their
            teacher, who is a really strong, octopus-looking creature. Even
            though their job is to kill the teacher, all of the students grow to
            love him as he is an amazing teacher and loves all of his students.
            It's a lighthearted and funny anime, that has 2 seasons and 1 movie
            recap. I like it because it was one of my first animes and the story
            is well written. It's really funny regardless of the bizarre plot
            and really easy to watch. Also I really like the relationship
            between the teacher and his students.

          <h2>Attack on titan</h2>
          <p>
            In this story there are giant creatures known as Titans, that attack
            the villagers of a certain island and eat them. A young boy and his
            2 best friends, who are really interested in the world outside of
            the walls that keep them save form the titans decide to join the
            military and fight against the walls, for both revenge and freedom.
            While fighting against the Titans, the military also tries to figure
            out what these creatures are thinking and where they're coming from.
            It sounds like a really weird anime, but it's extremely
            well-written. Not only does it have incredible plot twists, but also
            amazing characters and a good storyline. I must warn that it's quite
            graphic and sometimes even disturbing, but it's absolutely worth
            watching.

            A seemingly ordinary boy called Rin Okumura was living a normal life
            until he witnessed a guy being possessed and accidentally awakens
            the powers seales within him and also finds out that he is the son
            of Satan. He then decides to become an exorcist and defeat satan
            himself. I don't really remember that much of this anime, since I
            watched it quite a while ago. But the first intro was really good
            and I really liked the characters along with the fight scenes. It's
            also an interesting story since the son of satan himself decides to
            fight demons and kill satan.

            A guy named Nakajima Atsushi, who got kicked out of the orphanage
            that he was staying at, met really bizzare men from the Armed
            Detective Agency, which is an agency that is said to solve cases
            that the military and the police won't touch. The only people that
            can get into that organisation are people that possess unsual
            powers. Atsushi accompanied them on a mission to find a man-eating
            tiger that has been attacking the population, only to find out that
            he also possessed an unusal ability. I almost put this one in the
            psychological category since it is quite psychological with half of
            the characters being traumatised from something. But since it has
            quite a lot of fights and action scenes I decided to put it the
            fantasy category. I like it because of the well-written characters,
            they all have a good story that explains most of their behaviour and
            makes the story more interesting. The anime would be quite average
            if it weren't for the psycholigcal part, and that's pretty much the
            only thing I think is worth recommending.

          <p>
            A 12 year old boy named Gon decides to follow his dads footsteps and
            become a hunter, which is a job that requires a lot of talents. In
            order to become a hunter you have to take the hunter exam. He takes
            the exam with his goal being to find his father, who dissappeared to
            become a hunter. This is one of my favourite animes ever. I really
            like that every important character that is introduced always stays
            an important part of the story, no matter how many more characters
            get introduced. For example, the people that Gon met in the Hunter
            exam were still involved in the story even in the last arc, even
            though they easily could have left out those characters in the new
            arcs. The characters are sweet and the fight scenes are good. It is
            a really exciting and fun anime to watch and it has a bunch of
            episodes.

            is this a really classic anime, but the outfits of the characters
            are truly gorgeous. Not only the outfits, but the story is also
            really good and it's a really popular anime. It is the typical anime

            A guy who was naturally strong and didn't even know curses existed
            ended up eating the finger of the king of all curses, who has been
            sealed a long time ago. Normally he wouldn't be able to survive
            eating it, but since his friends were in danger and he's naturally
            stronger, he ended up surviving with the king of all curses, Sukuna,
            living inside of him. Since he now had Sukuna in him, the strongest
            sorcerer took him in and they allowed to let the guy live as long as
            he was willing to eat all 20 of Sukunas fingers and then sacrifice
            himself. The guy accepted and they started training him to become a
            sorcerer aswell. I feel like I said this too often now but I really
            like the characters. But the story, the animation and the fight
            scenes are really good and it also has some funny scenes, which
            makes it a really well balanced and good anime in my opinion.

            Yuu was an orphan who was living an ordinary life in the orphanage
            along with his family, which consisted of the other children on the
            orphanage. Until some day there was a weird virus that killed all
            the adults, and the children who survived all got captured by the
            vampires. Yuu was also captured along with his family, but being as
            stubborn as he is he made a plan that would let his family and him
            escape from the vampires. The vampires however found out and killed
            Yuu's enitre family. He barely managed to escape but his hatred
            against vampires only grew with this and therefore he decided to
            fight against those vampires to revenge his family. I really like
            the relationship between Yuu and his family and also the comrades
            that he got later on. It has some plot twists, which keeps the story
            interesting, but I mainly liked it because of the cute friendship
            between Yuu and everyone else.

            a student who can read minds. Everyone seems to trust her since
            she's seemingly a really sweet and nice character, who wouldn't do
            anyone harm. Even after she kills her first victim, no one suspects
            her, until a classmate of hers realizes that something is off and
            starts suspecting her. From then on he tries to find evidence
            against her while Nana kills the students and tries to hide the
            evidence. In my opinion it's really similar to deathnote. It has a
            lot of tension and I really like the story aswell. I never heard
            anyone talk about this anime before but it's definetly worth a
            watch, since it only has 13 episodes.

          <p>
            The vampires of this world are threatened, because some creature is
            stealing their real names, which is something that should never be
            revealed or they will be cursed. Noé, who is a young vampire whose
            close friend was a victim of these attacks, goes to Paris in hopes
            to find The Book Of Vanitas, which is a book that can lift the curse
            if used correctly. There he finds Vanitas, a human who claims to be
            a vampire doctor. Vanitas is the owner of this book and he is also
            trying to save the vampires from the curses. Noé and Vanitas start
            working together since their mutual goal is to save vampires. I
            really like the dynamic between Noé and Vanitas, they're the typical
            sun and moon combination. One of them is tall and dresses fully
            white and he's a really sweet and caring characters who believes in
            justice and wants everyone to be happy, Vanitas is short and dresses
            fully black and he's cold and uninterested and he doesn't care who
            gets hurt as long as he gets what he wants. You can probably imagine
            how Noé helps Vanitas become more open and Vanitas protects and has
            a soft spot for him. Not only that, but it's an anime with a lot of
            fights but it's also really funny and has romance aswell.

          <h2>The promised neverland</h2>
          <p>
            There's this really cute orphanage with sweet children and a caring
            "mother". All of the children are waiting to get adopted, expecting
            a really caring family and nice friends. One day, the child who is
            getting adopted forgets her stuffed animal in the orphanage. Emma,
            who is one of the children in the orphanage runs after her to return
            the stuffed animal, only to find the girl dead in a van. Everything
            the children believed were lies, the orphanage is actually a farm
            that grows children to feed them to monsters. Being adopted means
            being sold to the monster, and the sweet and caring mother sold them
            purposely. Emma, together with the other orphans, started to plan an
            escape that would let them survive. I really like the plot, it's
            something I have never seen before and therefore it's intersting.
            But I also love the friendship between the orphans.

          <h2>Tokyo Ghoul</h2>
          <p>
            Ghouls are man-eating creatures that are disguised as humans in the
            population. Ken Kaneki is an inocennt guy that went on a date with
            the pretty girl that he always sees at the cafe. As he was walking
            her home, she attempted to eat him but he was saved by another
            ghoul. They saved him by exchanging his organs with those of his
            date, which turned him into a half ghoul. I really like the story
            and the characters. The first 2 seasons are really good and fun to
            watch. I personally don't like the other seasons, but the first 2
            seasons are definetly worth a watch.

          <h2>Dr.Stone</h2>
          <p>
            A weird light came upon earth and suddenly every human turned into
            stone. A young guy, who was really interested in science, managed to
            stay conscious within the stone for 3'700 years but when he woke up
            everyone else was still petrified and he decided to save everyone on
            earth and bring back all the technology from 3'700 years ago. He
            manages to build a house and save his close friend. Together, they
            were trying to build the world again and save the rest of humanity.
            It has a really nice plot and is also funny at times. It also
            includes a lot of scientific facts and formulas, which is really
            interesting to watch.
