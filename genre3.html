            Ash grew up in a really tough environment where he was repetitively
            raped and adopted as the heir of "Papa" Dino Golzine where he was
            forced into prostitution. When he turned 17 he forsake the place
            where he was living in. However, he was driven back to that place
            because the secret that drove Ash's brother mad during war linked
            back to Dino Golzine. Exactly around that time Eiji Okumura, a 19
            year old guy that came from japan to accompany a journalist, became
            Ash's acquintance and got mixed up in that mess. This is definetly
            my favourite anime because it includes a lot of different things
            like rape, child pornography, trauma et cetera. Nevertheless, Ash
            was able to open up to Eiji and they got really close really fast
            which is really fun to watch. They're completely different people
            with different experiences and therefore it's interesting to see
            them together. The story is also really good and I also like the
            characters.

          <h2>Moriarty The Patriot</h2>
          <p>
            In the late 19th century in the British empire the average citizen
            struggles a lot with being successfull, as the nobility in this
            country is mostly selfish and despicable. William James Moriarty,
            along with his 2 brothers have always hated the British nobility,
            which resulted in them wanting to fix the system by punishing the
            nobilitiy. I really like that it's kind of historical and also I
            like how the 3 brothers use their power and knowledge to fix it
            instead of abusing their power. Even though they are dangerous
            criminals it is still really interesting to watch.

            After his fathers death Langa transfers to a school in japan where
            he meets a guy named Reki, who really loves skateboarding. When Reki
            introduces Langa to a secret skateboarding race called "S", Langa
            quickly finds himself interested in skateboarding aswell. This one
            is actually a sports anime but I didn't want to add a new genre for
            one single anime. I really like that this anime is lighthearted and
            funny. The characters are really sweet and it's a really fun and
            short anime to watch.

            Saiki is a 16 year old high schooler with psychic powers that make
            his life unintersting. He can use these powers to get whatever he
            wants, but since he can read minds there are no surprises or secrets
            in his life. He always kept his powers under control in order to not
            hurt anyone else and live a calm life, but with the influence of his
            friends he learns to let loose. This is another lighthearted and
            sweet anime. It also doesn't have an exceptionally intersting plot
            but it's rather cute and funny, so it's worth watching when bored.

            even coming to a point where it can cry and laugh like a normal

          <h2>Violet Evergarden</h2>
          <p>
            Violet Evergarden always had incredible combat powers, which was the
            reason she ended up being used as a mere weapon by the military. Her
            only friend and protector during this time was Major Gilbert, who
            took great care of her and taught her a lot of things. But during a
            war Gilbert died, only leaving her the words "I love you". Violet,
            who was totally clueless as to what that was supposed to mean,
            decided to become an auto memory doll and write letters for others
            after war was over. She thought this way she could learn more about
            others' emotions and would be able to understand what the Major
            meant when he said those words. This is a really bittersweet and
            cute story to watch. It's a rather short anime but I really liked
            watching her becoming a skilled auto memory doll and eventually
            understanding what the Major meant.
